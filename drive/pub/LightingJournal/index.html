            When I was driving from St. Louis to Fort Collins over the summer, a drive I have taken many times, I noticed a billboard that said "Museam of Light" so obviously I got off the highway at the exit advertised and went to check it out. It was beyond my wildest expectations (more projections than light but still) this room was completely covered in projectors floor to ceiling and they had some really cool animations running.

            From yet another trip to Vegas- I swear I'm not a gambling addict this one was with my parents over a year ago but it's the Grateful Dead at the Sphere so obviously it goes in the lighting journal. I still have no idea how they did this effect with the screens but they made the spherical space feel like a rectangular prism and I lost my mind.

            This is what I have for when my roommates and I throw parties- I just have them on sound activated mode so I can enjoy my own parties but they work decently well and are a very fun addition. I also like whoever made the sound mode's style- "if we don't know what they're playing might as well just go crazy" seems to be their mindset which is so chaotic but I love it.
